= MLB Parks Map Demo

== Setup

=== Kubernetes



=== OpenShift

You will need the OpenShift Client binary application	`oc`.  If it is
not installed on your system you can get binary builds from the
OpenShift Github repository:
https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases/

	`oc login <openshift API URL>`

For systems with a single-signon you may also need to get a login
token. If so, the `oc` command output will contain instructions.

You'll also need to note the location of your provider
configuration. For Kubernetes or OpenShift the default will be
`${HOME}/.kube/config`
